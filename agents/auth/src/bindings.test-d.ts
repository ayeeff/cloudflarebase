/**
 * Type-level tests for the consumer binding contract. No runtime component -
 * `npx tsc --noEmit` is the assertion.
 *
 * The negative cases carry `@ts-expect-error`, so this file fails the typecheck
 * in both directions: if the contract stops rejecting a bad `Env`, the
 * suppression becomes unused and TypeScript reports it. Weakening
 * `AuthAgentBindings` therefore breaks the build here rather than silently
 * letting a misconfigured install through.
 *
 * The namespaces are parameterised by the concrete agent class because that is
 * what `wrangler types` emits in a consumer project. Testing with
 * `DurableObjectNamespace<never>` would be misleading: `never` fails the
 * contravariant check that a real class passes.

/**
 * This repository's own `Env` is a consumer of the contract like any other. If

 * configuration, this fails the agent typecheck rather than someone's install.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `bindings.ts` so it stays out of the published
 * declarations, where it would be evaluated against the consumer's `Env` and
 * report an error inside `node_modules` - and be silently skipped anyway by the
 * `skipLibCheck: true` that most Workers projects set.
